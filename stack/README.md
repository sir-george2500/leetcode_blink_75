# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is similar to a stack of books where you can only add or remove books from the top. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack.

## Basic Operations

A stack supports the following basic operations:

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Peek (Top)**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Common Use Cases

Stacks are widely used in various applications, including:

- **Function Calls**: Storing the return addresses and local variables of function calls.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Evaluating arithmetic expressions (using the postfix notation).
- **Undo Functionality**: Implementing undo functionality in text editors or software applications.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Used in algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Browser History**: Storing the history of visited web pages.
